This is my submission to the problem Backend developer PS - To develop a social connection module using PHP and MySQL
Shubham Aggarwal

The database name is backend, backend.sql is provided in the folder
import that file into the database

open localhost/socialconnection/

index.php contains user login and sign up, both are implemented on the same page
if user is not already registered, he can click signup, logion will be disabled for that username
else, he can sign up, login will be disabed

profile.php contains update from friends section and post a update section, posting any update will go to postupdate.php to execute sql query for update.

friends.php contains three sections, pending friend requests, friends and all users

logout will get the user logout.
